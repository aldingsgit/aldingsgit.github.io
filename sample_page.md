### New England Spring

Every May, the endless epoch of winter exhales one final time.

Crawling out from the depths of the frozen desert, 

Summer emerges, naked and trembling,

Slowly inching along,

Before one day, growing too big, 

The pregnant bloom of the plodding equinox sweeps aside the dry tundra.

But shame on me for forgetting..

There's no such thing as a New England spring!

Next year, I won't be fooled again.
