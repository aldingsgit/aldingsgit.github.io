## Bayesian Thinking For the Aspiring Intern (5/19)

### The Math Works Out

Whether you’re a grizzled PhD student or green undergrad, you’ll be asked around May a question innocent enough but still heavy with gravitas.

What are you doing this summer?

Every hungry, bright-eyed student has been trained to dedicate precious summer months to interning since learning the terms Kleiner Perkins and Mckinsey. 

And as the post-offer bliss and visions of an idyllic corporate dream fade, they are quickly replaced by the harsh uncertainty that a full-time offer and the privelages of that life are far from guaranteed. 

Take my friend who has accepted an MBA internship at a well-known tech firm (ie. FAANG).

He is thrilled and excited by the opporunity but has already began brooding over the odds of a fulltime offer.

And as fantasies and doubts intermingle throughout his psyche, he is left wondering: 

What is the probability of being hired fulltime as a summer intern?

Well, good thing we have statistics to tell us about the mathematics of dealing with this uncertainty. 

### Thanks Bayes

Bayes Rule will tell us the probability of an event based on an estimate of the prior distribution. 

The prior distribution can be understood as a proxy measurement of previous knowledge or information associated with the event. 

More formally, the prior distribution is the probability of an observed dataset given a population parameter theta. 

This is an exact reversal of the logical ordering that we are trying to estimate, the posterior distribution: the probability of a population parameter given the data set.

This idea was immortalized either elegantly or tersely (depending on whether you’re a math major):

$$ P(A | B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

So in the case of my intern friend, 




He should feel good and optimisti cabout the future while acknowledging there is some level of uncertainty simply outside of his control. And

 it's funny because if you subscribe at all to the power of positive thinking or habiets of mind, then this is how he should have acted and believed all along. 

We didn't need all this math and statistics to get here but it sure feels nice.

## Shower Thoughts (5/19)

### Spring

Every May, the endless epoch of New England winter exhales one last time.

Crawling out from the depths of the frozen desert, 

Summer emerges, naked and trembling,

Slowly inching along,

Before one day, growing too big, 

The pregnant bloom of the plodding equinox sweeps aside the dry tundra.

But shame on me for forgetting..

There's no such thing as a New England spring!

Next year, I won't be fooled again.
