### Spring

Every May, the endless epoch of New England winter exhales one last time.

Crawling out from the depths of the frozen desert, naked and trembling.

Before finally, the levee breaks and 

The pregnant bloom of the plodding equinox sweeps aside the dry tundra.

But shame on me for forgetting..

There's no such thing as a New England spring!

Next year, I won't be fooled again.
