## Spring in the Bay State (5/19)

---

### Leisure writing

Every May, the endless epoch of New England winter exhales one last time.

Amidst the chaos of a final storm, summer emerges naked and unprepared -

As if by some arcane transformation, the tundra winter-scape was instantly inundated 

By the pregnant bloom of the approaching equinox.

But we tell ourselves we’ve seen this one before; we already know.

No such thing as a New England spring! How could we forget about it?

They won’t fool me next year…
