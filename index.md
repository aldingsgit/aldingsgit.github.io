### Spring

Every May, the endless epoch of New England winter exhales one last time.

Amidst the chaos of a final mercurial storm, summer reluctantly emerges 

Fully naked and trembling.

Before finally, 

The pregnant bloom of the plodding equinox sweeps aside the dry tundra.

But shame on me for forgetting..

There's no such thing as a New England spring!

Next year, I won't be fooled again.
