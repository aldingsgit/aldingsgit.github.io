## Bayesian Thinking For the Aspiring Intern (5/19)

### The Math Works Out

Whether you’re a grizzled PhD student or green undergrad, you’ll be asked around May – what are you doing this summer?

A seemingly innocent question, but heavy with gravitas, that quietly weighs on your mind while sinking deeper into your conciousness.

Every bright-eyed, hungry student has been trained to dedicate precious summer months to one thing and one thing only - career advancement opportunities as an intern. 

And as the post-offer bliss and visions of an idyllic corporate life fade, they are quickly replaced by the harsh uncertainty that the internship may or may not result in a full-time offer. 

This is the exact situation a good friend of mine is in; he’s accepted an MBA internship at a well-known technology firm (ie. FAANG) and is beginning to worry about ensuring that he gets a fulltime offer as well.

As doubts creep through his mind, he wonders what is the likelihood of him being hired fulltime, now that he’s gotten the internship offer?

Well, good thing we have statistics to tell us about this uncertainty. 

Specifically, Bayes Rule will tell us the probability of an event based on an estimate of the prior distribution. 

The prior distribution can be understood as a proxy measurement of previous knowledge or information associated with the event. 

More formally, the prior distribution is the probability of an observed dataset given a population parameter theta. 

Colloquially, we might call theta  or formally

This idea was immortalized either elegantly or tersely (depending on whether you’re a math major):

$$ P(A | B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

### Spring

Every May, the endless epoch of New England winter exhales one last time.

Crawling out from the depths of the frozen desert, 

Summer emerges, naked and trembling,

Slowly inching along,

Before one day, the levee breaks. 

The pregnant bloom of the plodding equinox sweeps aside the dry tundra.

But shame on me for forgetting..

There's no such thing as a New England spring!

Next year, I won't be fooled again.
