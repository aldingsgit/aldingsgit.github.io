## Spring in the Bay State (5/19)

---

### Leisure writing

Every May, the endless epoch of New England winter exhales one last time.

Amidst the chaos of a final mercurial storm, summer emerges naked and unprepared.

Before finally, by some arcane transformation, 

The pregnant bloom of the plodding equinox sweeps aside the dry tundra.

But shame on me for forgetting..

There's no such thing as a New England spring!

Next year, I won't be fooled again.
